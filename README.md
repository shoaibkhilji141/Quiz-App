Project Title: Quiz App using C# .NET WinForms, SQL Server, and Google Drive API

Description:

This Quiz Application is a desktop-based project developed using C# and .NET WinForms, integrated with SQL Server for data storage and management. The app allows administrators to create, update, and delete quiz questions, and enables users to take quizzes with real-time scoring and feedback. User results and quiz data are stored securely in a local SQL database. Additionally, the app integrates the Google Drive API to back up quiz results and exported reports (e.g., PDF or Excel) directly to the user's Google Drive, ensuring data redundancy and cloud access. The application features a clean UI, user authentication, timed quizzes, and performance analytics.
